# Modelling in Quant Finance
A collection of notes I created when learning quantitative modelling in finance.

**Who am I?**

I am a PhD in mathematics, currently preparing for a career in quantitative finance.

**Why these notes?**
For a quant role, I need maths + finance. The maths part is okay given I am a maths PhD, but for finance I decided to study it from scratch and therefore created these notes.

**What does the notes cover?**
I am learning the course "Financial Engineering and Risk Management" on Coursera, which introduced many financial models to study and play with. These notes are mostly my thoughts, ideas and experiments of some interesting models given in the course. 

**How this can be helpful for you?**
If you are also a student in science or engineering, and wants to learn (quant) finance from scratch, then these notes may provide some help for you (at least from the modelling perspective).
